                        <p>The garden's Fountain of SHS in San Nicolas III, positioned 
                            within the garden, stands out as one of the finest locations 
                            in my view. The fountain has significantly influenced the 
                            overall aesthetics of the garden. However, a notable drawback 
                            is the poor cleanliness of both the environment and the 
                            fountain water. The neglect of regular cleaning has resulted 
                            in discolored, green water, creating an unpleasant visual 
                            impression. Nonetheless, if efforts are directed towards 
                            maintaining cleanliness and improving the water flow system, 
                            I am confident that this garden could become one of the 
                            premier spots within SHS in San Nicolas III.
